# Microservices

In this project, I have developed a ecommerce web application named 'AbhiShop' to demonstrate the technicalities involved in developing a Microservices model from scratch. If you are curious to understand why should someone move from a traditional design such has Monolithic to Microservices, I have written a detailed blog explaining each and every step. Below is the link to each article. This repo consists of the source code I have developed which I have explained in the article.
